# Even-Odd Deep learning classifier 
Uses neural nets to determine if a number is even or not

### Tech used - 
* Keras
* Tensorflow backend

### How it works -
Neural net takes a array(8,1) input of any number in binary form
so the number is represented as a base 2 number in reverse order in the array.
Hence the first bit of the array represent if the number is even or not.
